Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for developers seeking fine-grained
control and flexibility when building advanced AI agents that are tightly
integrated with services in Google Cloud. It allows you to define agent
behavior, orchestration, and tool use directly in code, enabling robust
debugging, versioning, and deployment anywhere ‚Äì from your laptop to the cloud.


---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions,
  OpenAPI specs, or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse
  capabilities, all for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.

- **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration
  directly in Python for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.

- **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing
  multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.

- **Deploy Anywhere**: Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or
  scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.


## üöÄ Installation

You can install the ADK using `pip`:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

deploying agents:

* **[Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs)**

## üèÅ Feature Highlight

### Define a single agent:
```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a multi-agent system:
Define a multi-agent system with coordinator agent, greeter agent, and task execution agent. Then ADK engine and the model will guide the agents works together to accomplish the task.
```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="Greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash")
task_exectuor = CustomAgent(name="TaskExecutor") # A subclass of BaseAgent, as a Non-LLM agent.

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_exectuor
    ]
)

```

### Development UI

A built-in development UI to help you test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```

**_An open protocol enabling communication and interoperability between opaque agentic applications._**

<!-- /TOC -->

One of the biggest challenges in enterprise AI adoption is getting agents built on different frameworks and vendors to work together. That‚Äôs why we created an open *Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol*, a collaborative way to help agents across different ecosystems communicate with each other. Google is driving this open protocol initiative for the industry because we believe this protocol will be **critical to support multi-agent communication by giving your agents a common language ‚Äì irrespective of the framework or vendor they are built on**. 
With *A2A*, agents can show each other their capabilities and negotiate how they will interact with users (via text, forms, or bidirectional audio/video) ‚Äì all while working securely together.

### **See A2A in Action**

Watch [this demo video](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-developer-goog-blog-assets/original_videos/A2A_demo_v4.mp4) to see how A2A enables seamless communication between different agent frameworks.

### Conceptual Overview

The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol facilitates communication between independent AI agents. Here are the core concepts:

*   **Agent Card:** A public metadata file (usually at `/.well-known/agent.json`) describing an agent's capabilities, skills, endpoint URL, and authentication requirements. Clients use this for discovery.
*   **A2A Server:** An agent exposing an HTTP endpoint that implements the A2A protocol methods (defined in the [json specification](/specification)). It receives requests and manages task execution.
*   **A2A Client:** An application or another agent that consumes A2A services. It sends requests (like `tasks/send`) to an A2A Server's URL.
*   **Task:** The central unit of work. A client initiates a task by sending a message (`tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`). Tasks have unique IDs and progress through states (`submitted`, `working`, `input-required`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).
*   **Message:** Represents communication turns between the client (`role: "user"`) and the agent (`role: "agent"`). Messages contain `Parts`.
*   **Part:** The fundamental content unit within a `Message` or `Artifact`. Can be `TextPart`, `FilePart` (with inline bytes or a URI), or `DataPart` (for structured JSON, e.g., forms).
*   **Artifact:** Represents outputs generated by the agent during a task (e.g., generated files, final structured data). Artifacts also contain `Parts`.
*   **Streaming:** For long-running tasks, servers supporting the `streaming` capability can use `tasks/sendSubscribe`. The client receives Server-Sent Events (SSE) containing `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` messages, providing real-time progress.
*   **Push Notifications:** Servers supporting `pushNotifications` can proactively send task updates to a client-provided webhook URL, configured via `tasks/pushNotification/set`.

**Typical Flow:**

1.  **Discovery:** Client fetches the Agent Card from the server's well-known URL.
2.  **Initiation:** Client sends a `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe` request containing the initial user message and a unique Task ID.
3.  **Processing:**
    *   **(Streaming):** Server sends SSE events (status updates, artifacts) as the task progresses.
    *   **(Non-Streaming):** Server processes the task synchronously and returns the final `Task` object in the response.
4.  **Interaction (Optional):** If the task enters `input-required`, the client sends subsequent messages using the same Task ID via `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`.
5.  **Completion:** The task eventually reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).

    *   Formalize inclusion of authorization schemes and optional credentials directly within the `AgentCard`.
*   **Agent Collaboration:**
    *   Investigate a `QuerySkill()` method for dynamically checking unsupported or unanticipated skills.
*   **Task Lifecycle & UX:**
    *   Support for dynamic UX negotiation *within* a task (e.g., agent adding audio/video mid-conversation).
*   **Client Methods & Transport:**
    *   Explore extending support to client-initiated methods (beyond task management).
    *   Improvements to streaming reliability and push notification mechanisms.

**Sample & Documentation Enhancements:**

*   Simplify "Hello World" examples.
*   Include additional examples of agents integrated with different frameworks or showcasing specific A2A features.
*   Provide more comprehensive documentation for the common client/server libraries.
*   Generate human-readable HTML documentation from the JSON Schema.
